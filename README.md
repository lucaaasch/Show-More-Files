## About the snippet usage

To add styles to files you want, you **must first configure** the CSS file. 

1. Open the file "Style for Quick Switcher.css" (Visual Studio Code recommended)
   
2. In the lines of code where it says "[data-path$=".example1"]", you have to replace it with the file extension to customize.
   
3. Just below those lines, there is a customizable code block where you can change the different style characteristics (font, size, border)
   
  > In the CSS file it is specified what each line of code does so that you can change it to your liking, it is quite simple
